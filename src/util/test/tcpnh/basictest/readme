Utility kit for testing
-----------------------

Introduction
------------
	This utility contains source files which can be used as a template for
testing various modules. It contains timer utility, test menu, test server and
test client. The user can add/modify specified sections of the source according
to the needs of the module under testing.

Description of files
--------------------
	timerdef.h, .cpp : contains declaration of the timer handler, timer
			   thread create and delete functions, timer hander
			   create and delete functions. It also contains the
			   timeout handler where the user can specify the
			   action to be done (eg. send timeout to a module) on
			   timer expiry.
	testmenu.h, .cpp : contains the testmenu which is a list of test names
			   and the corresponding test functions. The user can
			   add tests here. It also contains functions
			   to open connection, send and receive  between the
			   test client and server.
	testfunctions.h, .cpp : contains the test function definitions. The user
			   can define test functions here.
	testserver.cpp	: the test server which waits for input from the client
			  and executes the test function. The user can create
			  and initialise the module before testing starts.
			  And cleanup the module after testing.
	testclient.cpp	: test test client which takes input from the user and
			  sends it to the server.
			 

Modifications
--------------
	User should make the following modifications

testserver.cpp : Add initialisation and cleanup code here.
testclient.cpp : Change the ipaddr of the test server.
testmenu.cpp : Add test name and test functions here.
timerdef.cpp : Add timeout action here.
Makefile : Define TEST_SERVER for making the server.


// Following Section Added By Vijaya Kumar

Running Test Program.
-----------------------

- There is no Remote Setup
- One setup act as both remote and local

Server Mode Complilation
------------------------
	Server : Test program
	Client : User Interface
	
	creating executable : make SERVER=1 
	
Single Mode Compilation:	
------------------------
	creating executable : make 

Change the following values before creation of executable
----------------------------------------------------------

testserver.cpp	: 
	ipaddr [] = {x, y, z, a}
	
testclient.cpp	:
	CDTEST_SERVER_IPADDR

testmenu.h	:
	CDTEST_SOCK_PORT

parameter.h	:
	MAX_NO_CONN	// Acording to your Load Test
	MAX_SEND_DATA_ATTEMPT	// Acording to Load Test
	ISMIMSGINTF	// Defines what type of MI Interface
	ISUIMSGINTF	// Defines what type of UI Interface
