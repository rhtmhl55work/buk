	This is one demo program of usage of TCP Network Handler.

Concept:

  There are Two Entity.

   1. Mp3 Stream Server.
   2. Mp3 Stream Client:
   	


Mp3 Stream Client can feed {mount} songs to Stream Server to unique mount point(logical)
{you can think mount point as a channel} So there can be multiple client each can feed 
different songs to Server.

Using Xmms we can listen to any songs 


Ex:

 	Assume That Client 1 feeds Kannada Songs.
		Client 2 feeds English Songs
		Client 3 feeds Hindi Songs


	Then using xmms , we can listen to any of these 3 songs.


Running 
-------

1. Open mp3StreamServer.cpp make sure that STREAMSERVERPORT
		LISTENERSERVERPORT
		MSG_DIST_UDP_PORT 
		are not in use.
	
	STREAMSERVERPORT : Over this port Stream Server is Listening for Stream Client
	to feed songs.
	LISTENERSERVERPORT : Over this port Stream Server Listening for Xmms(or Such
			Client) to play songs to xmms.
	MSG_DIST_UDP_PORT : message Distributor Port. 

	change localIpAddr 

2. run make
3. run ./mp3StreamerServer
4. Run 3 instance of mp3StreameClietn as follows

	a) ./mp3StreamerClient <ipAddress where mp3StreamServer is running>  STREAMSERVERPORT    kannada.mp3    /mnt/kannada
	b) ./mp3StreamerClient <ipAddress where mp3StreamServer is running>  STREAMSERVERPORT    english.mp3    /mnt/english
	c) ./mp3StreamerClient <ipAddress where mp3StreamServer is running>  STREAMSERVERPORT    hindi.mp3    	/mnt/hindi

5. Open 3 XMMS on different Machine
	Open Following 3 Urls in 3 XMMS
	a) <ip address where mp3StreamServer is	running>:LISTENERSERVERPORT/mnt/kannada
	b) <ip address where mp3StreamServer is	running>:LISTENERSERVERPORT/mnt/english
	c) <ip address where mp3StreamServer is	running>:LISTENERSERVERPORT/mnt/hindi
